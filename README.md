 The provided code is part of a project that involves clustering customers of a retail store based on their demographic and purchase behavior. The project uses the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers into segments. The relevant features for clustering include 'Age,' 'Annual Income (k$),' and 'Spending Score (1-100).' The code performs data preprocessing, determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method, applies K-means clustering, and visualizes the results with a scatter plot. This segmentation can help the retail store understand and tailor their marketing strategies to different customer groups.
